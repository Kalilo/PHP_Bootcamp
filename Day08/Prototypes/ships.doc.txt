<- Ships -----------------------------------------------------------------------

This serves as the main ship class. The class stores a local copy of all major
factors affecting ships.

The class serves as a solution for all standard calculations involving a ship.

A verbose mode is avaiable by setting the verbose variable to true.
Additionally an interactive mode is avaiable, which can serve as a basic
interface as to what changes were made to the ship's state. This can be 
activated by setting the interact variable to true.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Methods:

getArray();
Returns an array filled with all variables related to the current ship's state.

getPos();
Returns an array containing the x and y position of the current ship.

getVel();
Returns the velocity of the current ship.

+++

TakeHit($damage);
Takes in a variable containing the damage to be delt to the ship, and Returns
the remaining HP of the ship. This method does take into consideration the
strength of a ships shield, and appropiately takes it into consideration.

If incorrect paramiters are passed to the constructor, then the ship's behavior
is undefined.
